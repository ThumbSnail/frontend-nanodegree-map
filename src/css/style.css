/* Interesting note from:
	 https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

	 Note that divs usually take their width from their containing element,
	 and empty divs usually have 0 height. For this reason, you must always
	 set a height on the <div> explicitly.

	 Also:
	 This CSS declaration indicates that the map container <div> (with id map)
	 should take up 100% of the height of the HTML body. Note that we must
	 specifically declare those percentages for <body> and <html> as well.

/* The images are preset sizes... I wonder if presetting the size of the div

	 the picture.  (Hmmm... maybe the width, too.  Just to make the description text
	 look a little nicer)
	 //...though isn't there even a graphical glitch when there's NO image to grab?
	 //would it be better to just delay calling .open() for a little bit?
	 //Nope!  The maps js didn't like the delay

	 margin: 0 auto for centering isn't working.  an infoWindow issue?

	 **presetting the div size does help cut down on some of the irritiating graphical
	 glitches.  However, the image still flashes as it loads.  


	 Huh, or is it because it auto-centers to where the infoWindow bubble is?  is that
	 what causes the flicker?  Because even with loaded graphics, 

		 **Ah, I think it's that. It draws the infoWindow.  Then it recenters and has to repaint
		 the map, and then it redraws the infoWindow.  


		 Okay, so setting the size of the div solves one graphical error (where it's drawing text over a nonexistent infoWindow bubble)
		 -The centering one... I think you do want it to recenter.  But is it worth the eye pain?
